I will try to be as concise as possible and avoid all the unnecessary jargon cough academia cough. I hope you not only enjoy the content but also learn something new.
Disclaimers:
I am not an expert on all of the topics I will be discussing. I am just a person trying to learn and share my thoughts.</description></item><item><title>Neural network acceleration</title><link>https://wassimseifeddine.com/posts/nn_acceleration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 17:55:13 +0200</pubDate><author>Wassim Seifeddine</author><guid>https://wassimseifeddine.com/posts/nn_acceleration/</guid><description>Why accelerate Well, we have neural networks, they are awesome, they work but there&amp;rsquo;s a problem. THEY ARE HUGE. We scaled from a hundred of millions of parameters to hundred of BILLIONS. This problem makes using neural networks in real life quite hard as you normally don&amp;rsquo;t have this huge computational capabilities to run them anywhere.
Neural networks have proven to be a very valuable tool in scenarios where the transformation from inputs to outputs is unknown.</description></item></channel></rss>
