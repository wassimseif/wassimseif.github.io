However, the project has faced several delays, and it seems that Apple is struggling to get it right. In this post, I will share my thoughts on the reasons behind these delays and what they mean for the future of Apple intelligence and AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Torchtitan: A PyTorch Library for Parallelism Techniques explained</title><link>https://wassimseifeddine.com/posts/torchtitan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 14:05:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://wassimseifeddine.com/posts/torchtitan/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Torchtitan is an excellent project to learn how to implement distributed training techniques for training massive language models on &lt;strong&gt;hundreds&lt;/strong&gt; of GPUs. I’ve been using it for a few months, and now that the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; is out, I thought it’d be a good idea to share a few posts about how to use it, what works and what doesn’t, what I learned while implementing these ideas in my own project.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
