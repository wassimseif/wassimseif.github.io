## Introduction
###  What are genomics foundation models


A foundation model is a large-scale machine learning system trained on vast amounts of data to develop a broad understanding of a particular domain.
While it serves as a versatile base for various tasks in that domain,
it may require fine-tuning or specialization to achieve optimal performance for specific applications


In other words, it is a model that we give it a lot of data and hope it understands how to work with it, for example, respecting tenses while generating
new sentences. The hope with genomics foundation models we can have a ChatGPT for biology, a system that is trained on a lot of data and then be able to use the patterns learned while generating new data. Can we build a model that is trained on RNA genomics data and then be to help us understand how the RNA works but recogizing patterns we can not recognize.



Much like how we through a lot of english text to a large language model and hope it understands english, it seems that
we can do the same with genomics data
