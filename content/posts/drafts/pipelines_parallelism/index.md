## 1. Introduction

Suppose you want to train a model 

### Why is it Important in Deep Learning?

As deep learning models become increasingly large and complex—think of massive transformer models used in natural language processing—the computational and memory demands exceed the capacity of a single device. Pipeline parallelism addresses this challenge by:

- **Enabling Training of Large Models**: By splitting the model across multiple devices, we can train models that are too big to fit into the memory of a single GPU.
- **Improving Efficiency**: It maximizes the utilization of all available hardware resources by keeping all devices busy processing data simultaneously.
- **Reducing Training Time**: By processing multiple micro-batches concurrently in different stages, it speeds up training without the need for additional devices.

In essence, pipeline parallelism is a crucial strategy for scaling deep learning models efficiently, making it possible to tackle more complex problems and achieve better performance.
