In this blog I will share my thoughts on machine learning, although some other topics might pop up. I will try to be as concise as possible and avoid all the unnecessary jargon \*cough\* academia \*cough\*. I hope you not only enjoy the content but also learn something new.

**Disclaimers**:

1. I am not an expert on all of the topics I will be discussing. I am just a person trying to learn and share my thoughts.
2. Posts are always WIP, I will try to keep them up to date but I might miss some things.
3. There will be mistakes in the posts. I will fix them as soon as I notice them, If you notice any mistakes please let me know by email.
4. If you have ideas of topics, please share them with me. I'm always keen to learn new things :)
