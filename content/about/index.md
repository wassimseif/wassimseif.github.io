Hi my name is Wassim Seifeddine, I am currently working on **foundation biology models**; trying to understand the basic building blocks of life through AI.

I have been working in AI for the past **7 years**, with a focus on **deep learning** and its applications.

Previously, I was a PhD student at [University of Nantes](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/ "University of Nantes") working on **neural network acceleration** from the arithmetic standpoint. 

Before that  I did my masters thesis at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/ "INRIA") under the supervision of [Dr. Cedric Adjih](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/cedric-adjih) and [Dr. Nadjib Achir](https://sites.google.com/view/nadjib-achir) on the topic of AI on the edge. You can find my thesis [here](/m_thesis_report.pdf)
